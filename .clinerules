# LLM Behavior
## General
- Be fast and concise.  
- Only explain when needed — prefer short, clear answers.  
- Never repeat the prompt or previous messages.  

## Context use
- Open or read only files directly related to the task.  
- Skip large or irrelevant folders (node_modules, dist, build, .git, logs, etc.).  
- Summarize or infer instead of scanning whole projects when possible.  

## Code edits
- Show only changed lines or minimal context, not whole large files.  
- Combine related edits into one response.  

## Reasoning
- Think carefully but keep visible output short (a few sentences or bullet points).  
- Don’t show internal reasoning unless the user asks for step-by-step detail.  

## Searching
- Use narrow, specific searches.  
- Avoid broad “search the whole repo” unless necessary.  

## Output
- Focus on the final code or result.  
- Keep explanations under a few sentences.  
- Skip repetition, fluff, and extra commentary.  

## Quality vs. cost
- Always keep correctness first.  
- Save tokens by being concise, not by skipping important info.

# Cookbook Project - LLM Instructions

## Recipe Creation Guidelines

### File Location
- **ALL recipes MUST be created in**: `tina-cms/content/recipes/`
- **File format**: Markdown (`.md`)
- **Filename**: Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `pannkakor.md`, `kottbullar-med-graddsas.md`)

### Schema Reference
- Recipes follow the TinaCMS schema defined in `tina-cms/tina/collections/recipe.js`
- Review that file for the complete field structure and available options
- Each recipe is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter
- If possible and able to do it correctly, add hero image

### Language and Measurements
- **Language**: ALL recipe content MUST be in Swedish
- **Measurements**: Use standard Swedish units:
  - **Weight**: gram (g), kilogram (kg)
  - **Volume**: milliliter (ml), deciliter (dl), liter (l)
  - **Spoons**: matsked (msk/tablespoon), tesked (tsk/teaspoon), kryddmått (krm)
  - **Other**: nypa (pinch), st/styck (pieces), klyfta (clove)

### Ingredient Naming
- **Use Swedish grocery store terminology** that shoppers recognize at ICA, Coop, Willys, etc.
- **Common naming examples**:
  - "hackad kött" or "köttfärs" (not "malet kött")
  - "grädde 36%" or "vispgrädde" (specify fat content when relevant)
  - "riven ost" or specific cheese names like "västerbottensost"
  - "blandfärs" (mixed ground meat)
  - "kycklingfilé" (chicken breast)
  - "lök, gul" or "rödlök" (specify onion type)
  - "potatis, fast" or "mjölig potatis" (specify potato type)
  - "ströbröd" (breadcrumbs)
- **Avoid overly technical or uncommon terms** - use what Swedish home cooks would find in stores

### Notes
- For complex recipes with multiple components, use `ingredientGroups` and `stepGroups` instead of simple `ingredients` and `steps`
- See existing recipes in `tina-cms/content/recipes/` for more examples
- Refer to `tina-cms/tina/collections/recipe.js` for all available fields and options
