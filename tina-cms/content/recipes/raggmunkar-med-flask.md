steps:
  - title: Prepare potatoes
    description: |
      Peel the potatoes and grate them using a coarse grater. Place the grated
      potatoes in a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out as much liquid as
      possible to ensure crispy raggmunkar.
  - title: Mix batter
    description: |
      In a large bowl, combine the grated potatoes with flour, egg, milk, and
      salt. If using onion, grate it and add to the mixture. Stir well to form
      a thick batter.
  - title: Heat the pan
    description: |
      Heat butter or oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat.
  - title: Fry raggmunkar
    description: |
      Scoop spoonfuls of the potato batter into the hot pan, flattening them
      slightly with the back of the spoon. Fry for 3-4 minutes per side until
      golden brown and crispy. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to
      drain excess oil. Repeat with remaining batter.

      In the same pan (or a separate one), fry the pork belly or bacon until
      crispy and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes.
